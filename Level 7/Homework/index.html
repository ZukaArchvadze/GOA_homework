    <h2>About my favorite character Alucard</h2>

    
<p><b>Alucard</b> (Japanese:アーカード) is a fictional character and the protagonist of the <b>Hellsing</b> manga and anime series created by <b>Hirano.</b> A vampire devoted entirely to the current head of the Hellsing family, Integra Hellsing, Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization against other vampires and evil forces, fighting with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only killing after a target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently allowing enemies more than one chance to kill him (though only seeking to be killed by a human, having grown bored of immortality and life).</p>
